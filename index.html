            <h1>Transfer Learning with TensorFlow and ML.NET</h1>
            <p>Welcome to the TransferLearningTF project! This project demonstrates how to leverage transfer learning
                using TensorFlow within the ML.NET framework to perform image classification tasks. The goal is to take
                advantage of pre-trained models and adapt them to classify new images, significantly reducing the time
                and data required for training from scratch.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>In this project, a pre-trained TensorFlow model is fine-tuned on a custom dataset to classify images into
                different categories. By using ML.NET, the trained model can be integrated into .NET applications for
                inference, making it a powerful tool for developers who want to implement machine learning without
                needing deep expertise in TensorFlow or Python.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Project Structure</h2>
            <p>The project is organized into several key components:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Model Directory</strong>: Contains the TensorFlow model files, including the pre-trained
                    model and the fine-tuned model after training.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Directory</strong>: Stores the dataset used for training and testing the model. The
                    images in this directory are organized by category, making it easy to feed into the training script.
                </li>
                <li><strong>TrainingScript.py</strong>: A Python script that handles the training process using
                    TensorFlow. This script includes data preprocessing, augmentation, and fine-tuning of the
                    pre-trained model.</li>
                <li><strong>ModelInference.cs</strong>: A C# code file that demonstrates how to load the trained
                    TensorFlow model into an ML.NET pipeline and perform image classification (inference) on new images.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>This structure ensures that each part of the project is modular and easy to manage. Whether you're
                looking to train the model, perform inference, or modify the dataset, the project layout is designed to
                be intuitive and straightforward.</p>

            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>To get started with this project, you'll need to set up your environment and download the necessary
                dependencies. Follow the steps below to set up the project on your local machine:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Clone the Repository</strong>: Start by cloning the repository to your local machine using
                    Git.</li>
                <li><strong>Install Dependencies</strong>: Use pip to install the required Python libraries and NuGet to
                    install the necessary .NET packages.</li>
                <li><strong>Prepare the Dataset</strong>: Organize your images into the appropriate directory structure
                    for training and testing.</li>
                <li><strong>Train the Model</strong>: Run the Python script to fine-tune the pre-trained TensorFlow
                    model on your dataset.</li>
                <li><strong>Perform Inference</strong>: Use the C# code to load the trained model and perform inference
                    on new images.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>This project utilizes transfer learning, a technique where a model trained on a large dataset is
                fine-tuned on a smaller, domain-specific dataset. The pre-trained model already knows how to recognize
                general features (e.g., edges, textures), so it can quickly adapt to the new task with fewer training
                examples.</p>
            <p>Here's a breakdown of the workflow:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Preprocessing</strong>: The images are resized and normalized to match the input size
                    expected by the pre-trained model.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Augmentation</strong>: Techniques like rotation, flipping, and zooming are applied to
                    artificially increase the size of the training dataset and improve model generalization.</li>
                <li><strong>Model Fine-Tuning</strong>: The final layers of the pre-trained model are replaced with new
                    layers suited to the specific classification task. The model is then trained on the new dataset.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Model Integration</strong>: The trained TensorFlow model is loaded into an ML.NET pipeline,
                    allowing for seamless integration into .NET applications.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>This project illustrates the power of transfer learning by combining the strengths of TensorFlow and
                ML.NET. It provides a flexible and efficient way to build image classifiers with minimal data and
                effort, making it accessible to a wide range of developers and researchers.</p>
